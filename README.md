# GraphQL.EntityFramework.Core
An experimental .NET Core library that integrates GraphQL and Entity Framework Core with minimal effort.

The aim of this project is to provide a GraphQL endpoint by providing only the DbContext. Further configuration of the schema and queries will be available but not required to get up and running fast.
